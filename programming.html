<h2> Programming </h2>


<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cameron has experience working in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, C/C++, and
  C#. His first experience in programming was with his interactions Max. Pushing to the limits of the software, and
  interfacing Max with many different protocols and other software, it became necessary to explore more traditional
  programming language. Max has had javascript integration for at least a decade at this point so it made sense to
  expand into js. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Node.js greatly expanded the possibilities of Max and allowed Cameron to
  greatly expand his work in Max, getting access to the wealth of packages available in node. Working with Node,
  Cameron has developed a <a class='link' href="https://github.com/cameronjohnstonmusic/youtube-chat-from-max"
    target="_blank">Youtube Chat Bot</a> for the <a class='link' href="https://www.fccla.org/live" target="_blank">FCCLA
    Worship Service Livestream</a>. The Node script uses the Youtube Broadcast API to post
  relevant chat messages in line with the service program. These share links to church events, donation links, and
  welcomes the virtual congregation to the service. Additionally, Cameron has expanded Maxâ€™s capabilities with Node,
  including <a class='link' href="https://github.com/cameronjohnstonmusic/Max-Text-to-Speech"
    target="_blank">text-to-speech</a>, <a class='link' href="https://github.com/cameronjohnstonmusic/QR-Generator-Max"
    target="_blank">QR code generation</a>, <a class='link'
    href="https://github.com/cameronjohnstonmusic/Youtube-in-Jitter" target="_blank">Youtube playback
    in jitter</a>, and reading/posting to Twitch chat.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cameron works extensive in hardware and software development and integration.
  With experience in arduino development, included building hardware integrations with soldering, Cameron has a built
  a number of personal and professional hardware projects with arduino. He designed and implemented the code and
  circuits for each project.</p>
